# Libft @ Hive Helsinki

Libft is an individual project at Hive that requires us to re-create some standard
C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a
library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We are limited to what exsisting functions we are allowed to use. The Challenge is trying
to create useful functions using only a select few. The Libft will be used in many future
projects to come, so it is important to update it with useful functions.
