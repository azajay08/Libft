# Libft @ Hive Helsinki

Libft is an individual project at Hive that requires us to re-create some standard
C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a
library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We are limited to what existing functions we are allowed to use. The Challenge is trying
to create useful functions using only a select few. The `libft` will be used in many future
projects to come, so it is important to update it with useful functions.

I continue to add new functions to the `libft`. I have been adding functions that could be considered 
useful and universal, not only specific to the projects that I am doing. I have also added
my project `ft_print` to the `libft`. This project was to recode the function `printf`. Because
we are restricted to certain functions in our projects. It is forbidden to use the `printf` function
so it is very handy to have my own one that I can use freely.
